title: This Thing Called a Game Dev Blog
---

So I've decided to start blogging about my game development antics and what better place to do it
than right on my Github? So I'm designing a point and click adventure game in Unity and I'm going
to use this as a space to talk about that process.

On this day in history a little cat named Ivar takes his first steps -
quite literally, actually. I finally drew up a sprite for little Ivar; No more square man! I 
decided it would be faster to use Unity's new in built bone aniamtion tools than to try to draw up
a sprite sheet so I created him in a psb file with all his bits in different layers. So far no
animation. He just stares at you with his blank, dead, mildly cute eyes as you press the arrow keys 
to move him back and forth. I did rig him up though; Still trying to decide if I used to many bones
for the tail. My instinct is to make it as prehensile as possible so it can be a tool for conveying 
emotion, same as for a real cat. He's a pretty simple little guy so there isn't much room for 
expression anywhere else. I've also been working on makeing the other art assets balanced between 
aesthetically pleasing and optimized performance. I don't have very many of those yet, as I wanted
to focus on basic gameplay before building levels, so this is pretty easy for now.
